    "Below, we construct a fully connected neural network. To construct a neural network in PyTorch, we define a class that inherits from the nn.Module class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The class contains two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) init: Defines all the objects we will need.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) forward: puts all of these objects together, defining the network architecture. Basically, x starts out as your input tensor and is transformed step by step as it passes through each layer of the network. In this notebook, we consider MNIST images as our input tensors. Each image contains 28x28 pixels. The fully connected layers of the neural network, however, can only deal with one-dimensional feature vectors. So, we flatten the tensor, x, which is then passed on to the first fully connected layer, fc1. After the first fully connected layer, a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is applied element-wise to the tensor. The tensor is then passed through the second fully connected layer, fc2. After passing through the second fully connected layer, the transformed x is returned. The final tensor (x) represents the output of the neural network, which can be used for tasks like classification (you can rename x if you don't want to call the input and the output the same or if you want to distinguish between feature extraction and the final classification)."
